# Customer-Care-Management
Todo:
- Project already developed have an app Meta in test and we need to be Meta, currently an approval test has been done but it has been rejected. We only evaluate profiles that have already had an experience with Facebook apps and subsequent approval.
- The developer must have the ability to work with cloud systems and specifically with websockets. The project reads and sends emails from the platform. This functionality currently only works via websockets
- AI Chatbot Processing: The Chatbot analyzes the content of the message and provides an automatic response based on preset models.
Management of Manual Chats: If a customer requests to speak with a human operator, the Chatbot temporarily deactivates for that specific chat, and the operator can take over the conversation.
Sending Responses: Both automated and manual responses are sent to users via the API of the appropriate service provider.

Project already developed:

The project for the client aims to develop a centralized ERP system that integrates the various data sources of the company, currently fragmented and disorganized, into a single ERP/CRM system. This will enable advanced analytics and the use of artificial intelligence to enhance operational efficiency and global data management of the company.
First module to develop: Centralized Customer Care

System Structure (4 modules)

1) Centralized Customer Care: A unique platform for managing all customer interactions through various communication channels.
Unified Chat Management: A centralized platform to view and manage all chats from different channels and profiles.
Automated Response: AI chatbot to handle standard responses and filter complex requests to human operators.
- Main Features
Multichannel Management: Supports receiving and sending messages from various digital communication providers.
Unified Interface: Allows operators to view and manage communications from multiple events and profiles from a single screen.
AI Chatbot Integration: Utilizes an AI chatbot to automatically respond to chats based on the content and requests received.
Manual Escalation: Operators can manually intervene in chats when a more specific or personalized response is required.
- Logical Structure and Operational Flow
Provider Polling: The system performs periodic checks on various providers (WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, email) to check for new messages.
Reception and Classification of Messages: Received messages are classified and forwarded to the AI Chatbot for initial processing.
AI Chatbot Processing: The Chatbot analyzes the content of the message and provides an automatic response based on preset models.
Management of Manual Chats: If a customer requests to speak with a human operator, the Chatbot temporarily deactivates for that specific chat, and the operator can take over the conversation.
Sending Responses: Both automated and manual responses are sent to users via the API of the appropriate service provider.
- Operator Interaction
Selection of Profiles and Events: Operators can filter the chats displayed by event or specific company profile.
Provider Selection: Ability to select specific communication channels (e.g., only WhatsApp or email) to view related chats.
Chat Management: Chats are displayed in chronological order, with the ability to read the entire conversation, view details such as the event logo, the sender's profile, and the date/time of each message.
Response Features: Operators can respond directly from the chats, attach files if necessary, and see who responded to the messages (operator or chatbot).
- Database and Backend Technology
Interaction Database: Each chat is archived with complete details on the sender, date, time, and content, along with interaction logs with the Chatbot and operators.
Integration API: The system interfaces with the APIs of various communication providers to send and receive messages efficiently.
Security and Privacy: Implementation of robust security measures to protect communications and users' personal data in compliance with current regulations, such as GDPR.

Python Code Implementation
1. WebSocket Communication

import asyncio
import websockets

async def websocket_server():
    async with websockets.connect("wss://your_websocket_server.com") as ws:
        print("WebSocket connected")
        while True:
            message = await ws.recv()
            process_message(message)

def process_message(message):
    """
    Handles messages received via WebSocket, such as emails or chats.
    """
    print("Received message:", message)
    # Perform classification and route to AI Chatbot or operator
    handle_message(message)

asyncio.run(websocket_server())

2. Meta API Integration

import requests

META_API_BASE_URL = "https://graph.facebook.com/v16.0/"
ACCESS_TOKEN = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"

def check_meta_approval(app_id):
    url = f"{META_API_BASE_URL}{app_id}/permissions"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}"}
    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        print("Meta API Error:", response.text)
        return None

def send_message_to_meta(recipient_id, message):
    url = f"{META_API_BASE_URL}me/messages"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}"}
    payload = {
        "recipient": {"id": recipient_id},
        "message": {"text": message},
    }
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print("Message sent successfully.")
    else:
        print("Failed to send message:", response.text)

3. AI Chatbot Processing

from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

# Initialize ChatGPT Model
chatbot = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.7)

def analyze_message_with_chatbot(message):
    """
    AI Chatbot analyzes the message content and provides an automatic response.
    """
    prompt = f"""
    Analyze the following message and provide a suitable response:
    Message: {message}
    """
    response = chatbot.predict(prompt)
    return response

4. Manual Chat Management

def escalate_to_operator(chat_id, message):
    """
    Escalates the chat to a human operator when the chatbot cannot handle it.
    """
    print(f"Escalating Chat ID {chat_id} to operator.")
    # Update database or notify operator
    notify_operator(chat_id, message)

def notify_operator(chat_id, message):
    """
    Notify the operator about a new escalated chat.
    """
    # Send notification logic (e.g., via email or internal system)
    print(f"Operator notified for Chat ID {chat_id} with message: {message}")

def send_manual_response(chat_id, operator_id, message):
    """
    Allows the operator to respond to a chat manually.
    """
    print(f"Operator {operator_id} responding to Chat ID {chat_id} with: {message}")
    # Logic to send message via Meta API
    send_message_to_meta(chat_id, message)

5. Database and Backend Integration

import sqlite3

DB_FILE = "customer_care.db"

def setup_database():
    conn = sqlite3.connect(DB_FILE)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("""
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS chats (
            id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
            sender_id TEXT,
            message TEXT,
            timestamp DATETIME,
            status TEXT,
            assigned_to TEXT
        )
    """)
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

def log_chat(sender_id, message, status="new"):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(DB_FILE)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("""
        INSERT INTO chats (sender_id, message, timestamp, status)
        VALUES (?, ?, datetime('now'), ?)
    """, (sender_id, message, status))
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()

6. Multi-Channel Polling

def poll_providers():
    """
    Polls providers (e.g., WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, email) for new messages.
    """
    providers = ["WhatsApp", "Facebook", "Instagram", "Email"]
    for provider in providers:
        print(f"Polling {provider} for new messages...")
        # Logic to poll each provider's API

How It All Works Together

    WebSocket Listener:
        Continuously listens for new messages via WebSocket.
        Routes incoming messages to the chatbot or operator.

    Message Processing:
        AI chatbot analyzes the message for auto-response.
        Complex queries are escalated to an operator.

    Meta Integration:
        Polls Meta-approved channels for incoming messages.
        Sends responses (manual/automated) back through Meta API.

    Manual Chat Management:
        Allows operators to handle escalated chats via a unified interface.
        Supports filtering by provider, event, and profiles.

    Database Logging:
        Logs all chats and interactions into a centralized SQLite database.

Next Steps

    Approval:
        Resolve rejection issues with Meta by reviewing app compliance and permissions.
    Testing:
        Test WebSocket, Meta API, and chatbot functionalities in staging environments.
    Deployment:
        Use cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, GCP) to deploy the system.
    UI Development:
        Build a responsive front-end for operator interactions using React/Angular.

This setup provides a robust foundation for customer care management, integrating Meta, AI chatbots, and WebSocket-based real-time communication.
